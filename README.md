sqs2poscar
==========

A c++ code to convert `bestsqs.out` generated by mcsqs (ATAT) to `POSCAR` for VASP.

Compile: `c++ ./sqs2poscar.cpp -o ./sqs2poscar`

Usage: `sqs2poscar bestsqs.out`
  
Output file: `bestsqs.out-POSCAR`

Post-processing: The lattice constant is assumed to be 1.0. Change as necessary.

Note: `bestsqs.out` can be any file at present working directory.

### Update
After the code was released, c++ compiler on Linux seems to have added some changes to the default libraries. If you find the following errors:
```
sqs2poscar.cpp:218: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:222: error: ‘strcat’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:225: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
sqs2poscar.cpp:251: error: ‘exit’ was not declared in this scope
```

you can solve these errors by adding these two lines into the head of the `sqs2poscar.cpp` file:
```
#include <cstring>
#include <stdlib.h>
```
